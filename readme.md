===
A small and simple tool to encode and decode base64.

## Features
  * Encoding conversions to utf-8, ucs-2, and ascii.
  * Image drag and drop support.
  * Add-to-homescreen and offline support.

## Modifying
Just open [index.html](index.html). Everything except for https-only features (offline) works from the local filesystem.

An optional step is to run `gulp` to compress images and scripts. Instructions can be found in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js).
